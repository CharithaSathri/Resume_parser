# Resume_parser
This project is a lightweight web application built with Python, Streamlit, and PyMuPDF (fitz) that extracts important details from PDF resumes. The tool allows users to upload a resume and automatically extract fields such as Name, Email, Phone Number, and Skills (if structured well).
